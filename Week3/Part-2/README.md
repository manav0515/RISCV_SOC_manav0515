# Week 3 Task ‚Äì Static Timing Analysis (STA) Fundamentals

## üéØ Objective
To explore and internalize the **core ideas behind Static Timing Analysis (STA)** ‚Äî learning how setup and hold checks, timing paths, clocks, and constraints together ensure that a post-synthesis circuit runs safely at its target frequency.

STA may sound theoretical, but it‚Äôs the silent gatekeeper that decides whether silicon works on day 1 or fails under real conditions.

## üìñ Introduction
Imagine verifying a million-gate design without applying a single test vector.  
That‚Äôs **Static Timing Analysis**.

STA divides the entire design into **timing paths** and computes delays mathematically.  
It then checks whether every signal meets its setup and hold requirements ‚Äî across every possible condition of **process, voltage, and temperature** ‚Äî all **without simulation**.

This exhaustive coverage ensures reliability in the field and lets designers fix issues before tape-out.  
Think of it as a ‚Äútime-based audit‚Äù of your digital design.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Paths
A **timing path** represents the journey of a signal through logic ‚Äî from one flip-flop to another, or from an input pin to an output.  
Understanding them is essential; every delay, skew, and load along the way contributes to the circuit‚Äôs speed limit.

![Timing Path](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079770/190552665-bf99cee6-aba9-40b2-a0a8-101de7b8d329.png)

### Example
![Example Timing Paths](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079770/190560524-e101803d-cb67-4fc0-9532-a50b12e61c36.png)

A single chip contains thousands of such paths. STA ensures that even the *slowest* one meets setup time and the *fastest* one doesn‚Äôt break hold time.

---

## üîç Types of Setup & Hold Analyses
Every timing check falls into one of several path categories ‚Äî each revealing a different interaction between data and clock.

![Types of Checks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079770/190888247-335fa2a4-0370-498c-a171-d0b9fdbfb558.png)

### 1. **Reg-to-Reg (Register to Register)**
A path that begins and ends at flip-flops.  
It defines the clock-to-clock timing that dominates synchronous performance.

![Reg-to-Reg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190436869-395360d3-37b5-4490-9248-dcd04471b026.png)

**Think about it:** this is where setup and hold failures show up first.

Key Points  
- Data must remain stable around the clock edge.  
- **Setup violation:** data arrives too late.  
- **Hold violation:** data changes too soon.  
- Most common path in synchronous logic.

---

### 2. **In-to-Reg (Input to Register)**
From an input port to a register ‚Äî critical for capturing external data.

![In-to-Reg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190437220-79303d9c-c41b-4827-bef4-67d121b2abcf.png)

Key Points  
- Input delay is defined relative to clock.  
- Determines whether off-chip data can be sampled correctly.  
- Needs accurate board/interface timing info.

---

### 3. **Reg-to-Out (Register to Output)**
From a register to an output pin.  
Used to verify that internal data reaches the outside world on time.

![Reg-to-Out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190437614-f1ee053b-1de1-49eb-9b53-bb2f3cc50eb9.png)

Key Points  
- Controlled by **output delay** constraints.  
- Must meet setup of the external device.  
- Includes clock-to-Q and logic delays.

---

### 4. **In-to-Out (Input to Output)**
Pure combinational path without registers.  
Common in glue logic and mux structures.

![In-to-Out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190438268-c83677a9-b361-4253-ad3e-5931937d5b50.png)

Key Points  
- No clock involved.  
- Checked against maximum propagation delay.  
- Ensures combinational logic meets timing requirements.

---

### 5. **Clock Gating Analysis**
From clock pin through gating logic to gated clock output.  
Ensures enable signals don‚Äôt introduce glitches or metastability.

![Clock Gating](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190438984-51a8ecc5-a45a-4987-8ea3-be1bcf47cd6e.png)

Key Points  
- Enable must be stable before clock edge.  
- Uses dedicated ICG cells (integrated clock gating).  
- Prevents spurious clock pulses.

---

### 6. **Recovery & Removal Checks**
Asynchronous reset/set pins need special timing care.  
These checks guarantee that resets deassert safely relative to clock.

![Recovery Removal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190439696-dd8d1c9a-2378-4633-8740-46456a9e12fa.png)

- **Recovery check:** reset is released soon enough before next clock.  
- **Removal check:** reset stays inactive long enough after clock.  

Violating these can cause random start-up states and glitches.

---

### 7. **Data-to-Data Timing**
Sometimes two signals interact without a shared clock.  
Data-to-data checks ensure their relative arrival times are safe.

![Data-to-Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190460805-258982bf-a65f-4618-8e0d-864ea31e4745.png)

Key Points  
- Prevents race conditions in multiplexers or handshake logic.  
- Validates causal relationships between signals.

---

### 8. **Latch Timing (Time Borrow / Time Give)**
Unlike flip-flops, **latches are level-sensitive**, which lets them borrow time from the next stage.  
Used strategically to improve timing closure in pipelined designs.

![Latch Timing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190462109-b07a16c3-417e-467d-897b-3314a3adbefb.png)

Think of it as a friendly loan between neighboring stages ‚Äî but borrow too much, and you‚Äôll owe timing in the next cycle!

Key Points  
- Provides extra slack flexibility.  
- Needs careful balance to avoid cumulative debt (negative slack).  

---

## ‚ö° Slew & Transition Analysis
Every signal edge takes time to transition ‚Äî too slow, and power rises; too fast, and noise explodes.  
Slew analysis monitors this edge behavior.

### Data Slew (Max/Min)
![Data Slew](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190467735-0c3eec71-6df3-46c5-9595-34d08bc3eda4.png)

- **Max slew:** limits slow edges that increase short-circuit power and timing uncertainty.  
- **Min slew:** guards against too-sharp edges causing bounce and SI issues.

Think of it as controlling how ‚Äústeep‚Äù each digital edge is.

---

### Clock Slew (Max/Min)
The clock needs the cleanest edges in the design.  
Any deviation here directly shrinks timing margins.

![Clock Slew](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190467955-2c211a54-1f08-4a78-a116-da218d337e46.png)

Importance  
- Impacts setup/hold windows and jitter.  
- Managed during Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS).  
- Typically tighter limits than data signals.

---

## üìä Load Analysis
How much load a gate drives affects delay and power.  
STA tracks this through **fanout** and **capacitance** checks.

![Load Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110079770/190888536-3eb65ad6-2489-4fc1-8686-4ec74db1e40d.png)

### Fanout (Max/Min)
- **Max fanout:** too many loads ‚Üí slow edges ‚Üí timing issues.  
- **Min fanout:** too few loads ‚Üí signal integrity noise.

Buffers or repeaters are inserted to re-balance loads.

---

### Capacitance (Max/Min)
- **Max:** total gate + wire + parasitic capacitance limit.  
- **Min:** ensures there‚Äôs some load to stabilize signal.

Rule of thumb: large nets ‚Üí higher C ‚Üí slower transition ‚Üí need stronger drivers.

---

## üïê Clock Analysis
Clock quality defines design timing quality. STA looks at skew, pulse width, and timing windows.

### Clock Skew
![Clock Skew](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190468861-b79cae1c-5f51-4728-aa3b-ca8b91b99b0d.png)

**Definition:** difference in clock arrival times between registers.

- **Positive skew:** capture flop gets clock later ‚Üí helps setup, hurts hold.  
- **Negative skew:** capture flop gets clock earlier ‚Üí hurts setup, helps hold.

**Interactive note:** Try to guess ‚Äî if setup fails and you advance the capture clock, what happens? Exactly: you make it worse! Hence skew engineering is delicate.

---

### Pulse Width Check
Real clock trees distort duty cycles.  
Pulse width checks ensure high/low times meet library requirements.

![Pulse Width](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190469402-ff5fc3a0-d3fa-4979-976e-40db0b754897.png)

Violations can lead to flip-flops missing edges or entering metastability.  
Maintaining balanced rise/fall durations is key to robust timing.

---

---

## üéØ Reg-to-Reg Path Timing Parameters
This section dives into the heartbeat of STA ‚Äî the **register-to-register path**.  
It‚Äôs here that setup and hold constraints decide your clock frequency limits.

**Assume:** Clock Frequency = 1 GHz ‚áí Clock Period = 1 ns.

---

### üß© Understanding Slack
Slack = Required Arrival Time (RAT) ‚àí Actual Arrival Time (AAT)  
It measures **timing comfort zone** ‚Äî how early or late data reaches.

| Slack Value | Meaning | Action |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| +ve | Meets timing | Safe |
| 0 | Critical path | Monitor closely |
| ‚àíve | Timing violation | Fix required |

üß† **Think-through:** Negative slack means the design is asking the impossible ‚Äî it needs more time than the clock allows.

---

### üìò Example 1 ‚Äì Slack Computation
![Setup Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190431165-83bc4713-2b6a-4beb-a17d-6944258c8ff2.png)  
Max Slack = 3 ns ‚àí 3.5 ns = ‚àí0.5 ns ‚Üí **Setup Violation**

![Hold Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190429835-58719349-dfe6-4a48-a97c-cd1403a7c864.png)  
Min Slack = 3.5 ns ‚àí 0.5 ns = 3 ns ‚Üí **Hold Met**

---

### üìò Example 2 ‚Äì Another Scenario
![Setup2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190434143-0b421273-c59b-4926-bf26-92e58ae02069.png)  
Max Slack = 1 ns ‚àí 0.2 ns = 0.8 ns ‚Üí Setup OK  

![Hold2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190433799-0e17d633-518c-44a7-b92f-8fd36a6d680e.png)  
Min Slack = 0.2 ns ‚àí 0.3 ns = ‚àí0.1 ns ‚Üí Hold Fail  

‚è±Ô∏è Setup and Hold are mirror images ‚Äî fixing one may hurt the other.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Arrival Time (AT)
When does data actually arrive?  
AT = Clock Network Delay + Clock-to-Q Delay + Combinational Delay.  

Two views:  
- **Early AT:** best-case (min) delays.  
- **Late AT:** worst-case (max) delays.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Required Time (RT)
Deadline for arrival.

- **Setup check:** RT = Clock Period + Clk Delay ‚àí Setup Time  
- **Hold check:** RT = Clk Delay + Hold Time  

üìò Rule: AAT ‚â§ RAT for setup and AAT ‚â• RAT for hold.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Slack Equation
Slack = RT ‚àí AT  
Positive = Happy chip.  
Negative = Sad chip üôÇ  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Clock-to-Q Delay (Tcq)
Time from active clock edge to Q output change.  
Affects both setup and hold checks.

Typical Range: 50‚Äì300 ps  
Higher load = larger Tcq = slower data.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Time (Tsetup)
Minimum stability before clock edge.  

Equation:  
Tcycle ‚â• Tcq + Tcomb + Tsetup + Tskew + Tuncertainty  

üß† **Reflection:** Setup defines the *latest* moment data may arrive.

Violating it forces either frequency reduction or path optimization.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Hold Time (Thold)
Minimum stability after clock edge.  
Independent of period ‚Äî you can‚Äôt fix it by slowing clock!  

Equation: Tcq + Tcomb ‚â• Thold + Tskew ‚àí Tuncertainty  

Usually fixed by adding delays (buffers) on fast paths.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Jitter and Uncertainty
Jitter = random clock edge movement.  
Uncertainty combines jitter + variations + skew margin.  

Clock Period effective = T ¬± Œî  
Thus Setup RT = T ‚àí Tsetup ‚àí Jitter.  
Hold RT = Thold + Jitter.

Visualized using eye diagrams for realistic clock windows.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Textual Timing Reports
STA tools report timing in tabular text.  
You‚Äôll see net delays, cell delays, and slack values for each path.

Think of it as a map from launch flop ‚Üí capture flop annotated with numbers.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Graph-Based vs Path-Based Analysis

| Feature | GBA | PBA |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Speed | Fast (global) | Slow (per path) |
| Accuracy | Pessimistic | Realistic |
| Usage | Early design | Final closure |
| Pessimism | High | Low |

GBA is quick for coverage, PBA is truth for sign-off.

---

### üîπ Complete Reg-to-Reg Equations
**Setup:** Tclk ‚â• LaunchClk(late)+Tcq(max)+Data(max)+Tsetup‚àíCaptureClk(late)+Uncertainty‚àíCRPR  
**Hold:** LaunchClk(early)+Tcq(min)+Data(min) ‚â• CaptureClk(early)+Thold+Uncertainty‚àíCRPR

---

## üß¨ On-Chip Variation (OCV)
No two transistors are identical.  
Differences in process, voltage, and temperature create delay mismatch ‚Üí **OCV**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sources
1. **Process:** etching, doping, oxide thickness.  
2. **Voltage:** IR drop and dynamic fluctuations.  
3. **Temperature:** hot spots and thermal gradients.

---

### üìâ OCV Derating
Delays are scaled to simulate variation:  

Max Delay = Nominal √ó (1 + OCV)  
Min Delay = Nominal √ó (1 ‚àí OCV)  

Typical cell derate ‚âà ¬±10‚Äì15 %.  
Clock path derate ‚âà ¬±3‚Äì5 %.  
In this course ‚âà ¬±20 %.

---

### üß© Etching and Oxide Impact
Uneven etching alters W/L ratios ‚Üí changes drain current.  
Oxide thickness variation changes capacitance ‚Üí affects switch speed.  

Each inverter ends up with slightly different delay.  
This spreads out timing across the chip like ripples in water.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è OCV Timing and Pessimism Removal

### üîß Setup OCV Scenarios
![OCV Setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62461290/190919502-519015cf-38f2-4138-98ab-ddbf266e4425.png)

Four delay combinations exist (‚Üë or ‚Üì for DRT/DAT).  
- **Clock pull-in:** reducing capture delay.  
- **Clock push-out:** increasing launch delay.  

Combining gives a realistic worst-case picture.

---

### üßÆ Common Path Pessimism Removal (CRPR)
Both launch and capture flops share some clock path.  
Without CRPR, the tool double-counts variation ‚Üí extra pessimism.

**Rule:** A cell cannot have two delay values at once.  
Subtract the common difference to restore accuracy.

Result ‚Üí healthier slack and realistic timing sign-off.

---

### üïê Hold OCV
Hold analysis uses opposite derating.  
To stress worst case, launch delay is shrunk (pull-in) and capture delay expanded (push-out).  
If hold fails under these conditions, the design is non-recoverable.

---

## üìà Outcome
After completing this week‚Äôs study, you should be able to:

‚úÖ Identify and analyze setup/hold paths of all types.  
‚úÖ Compute slack and understand its impact.  
‚úÖ Interpret textual STA reports.  
‚úÖ Relate flip-flop internals to timing behavior.  
‚úÖ Explain OCV sources and their modeling.  
‚úÖ Apply CRPR to reduce false violations.  

---

## üéì Key Takeaways
1. STA verifies timing exhaustively ‚Äî no test vectors needed.  
2. Setup + Hold define upper/lower timing bounds.  
3. Clock integrity (skew, jitter, pulse width) is paramount.  
4. OCV captures manufacturing and environmental variability.  
5. PBA refines accuracy for sign-off.  
6. Hold violations are fatal; setup violations limit frequency.  
7. CRPR eliminates double-counted pessimism.  
8. Jitter and uncertainty shrink timing margins ‚Äî always account for them.  
9. A positive slack design means a happy tape-out.

---

## üìù Conclusion
We have now connected the dots ‚Äî from basic path timing to deep OCV and CRPR concepts.  
STA is not just a report of numbers; it‚Äôs the language your silicon speaks in time.

**Remember:**  
- Every path tells a story of data and clock racing each other.  
- A balanced design keeps them in sync.  
- STA lets you see that balance before hardware exists.
